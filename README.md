# Project README

## Overview

Welcome to the project README for the analysis of historical stock data for Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and IBM. This project aims to provide insights into the behavior of these tech stocks over time, focusing on their closing prices, daily fluctuations, and trading volumes. This README will guide you through the structure of the project and how to navigate through the provided notebook.

## Understanding the Project

The project is organized into sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the analysis. Here's a breakdown of what each section covers:

1. **Introduction to Raw Data Analysis**:
   - Describes the initial exploration of the raw data, highlighting key characteristics such as column titles, variable types, and dataset size.
   - Provides insights into the preprocessing steps required before further analysis.

2. **Loading and Preprocessing Data**:
   - Demonstrates how the raw data is loaded into pandas DataFrames for AAPL, MSFT, and IBM separately.
   - Explains the parameters used in the `read_csv()` function for each DataFrame, including handling headers, column selection, data types, and index setting.
   - Discusses the removal of NaN values and data type adjustments.

3. **Data Inspection and Visualization**:
   - Provides metadata for each DataFrame, including data types, non-null counts, and memory usage.
   - Offers a visual representation of the data through plots showing the closing prices of AAPL, MSFT, and IBM over time.
   - Identifies trends and patterns observed in the visualizations, such as growth periods and volatility.

4. **Measuring Fluctuation**:
   - Introduces a metric to measure the daily fluctuation of stock prices as a percentage of the closing price.
   - Presents visualizations depicting the distribution of fluctuations alongside closing prices for each stock.

5. **Further Analysis**:
   - Identifies the maximum fluctuation observed for AAPL and its significance.
   - Explores the correlation between fluctuation and trading volume for AAPL.

## Navigating the Notebook

To navigate through the project notebook efficiently, follow these steps:

1. Start with the **Introduction to Raw Data Analysis** section to gain an understanding of the dataset's structure and characteristics.
2. Proceed to the **Loading and Preprocessing Data** section to see how the raw data is processed into usable DataFrames.
3. Move on to the **Data Inspection and Visualization** section to explore visualizations of the stock data and interpret trends.
4. Review the **Measuring Fluctuation** section to understand how fluctuations are calculated and their relationship with closing prices.
5. Finally, explore the **Further Analysis** section for additional insights and conclusions drawn from the data.

## Conclusion

This README serves as a guide to understanding and navigating through the project notebook efficiently. Feel free to explore the code and visualizations in detail to gain insights into the historical behavior of AAPL, MSFT, and IBM stocks.
